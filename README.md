## Gender Bias Project - Individual Study - Spring 2020

My teammate and I collected resumes from LinkedIn of individuals in the computer science/data fields. Our goal was to create a classifier that would determine the gender 
(male or female) of the author of the resume. We completed collecting the resumes and cleaning the data. After, we began toying with classifiers but never completed this project. The presented files in this repo were used to clean the resumes and have them formatted in a certain way to feed to the classifier.
