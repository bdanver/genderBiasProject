Summary
My passion is to develop interactive technologies, from UI to
backend logic, guided by a human centered design to create the
most proficient and usable technologies.
The diverse amount of experience I’ve gained in professional
environments and research funded projects has given me the ability
to know a large variety of skills. These range from developing web
API's in C#, querying data from a SQL database, programming
within a .net core MVC frontend using Angular, building Unity
applications with VR and AR additions, hands on user testing,
functionality and API performance testing, communicating and
reporting testing results to teams and management, and designing
wireframes and updating both UI and UX.
