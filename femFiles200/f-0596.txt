Summary
Since I was young, I’ve always been interested in how computers
work. I started off teaching myself HTML and CSS. Now training as
a Java developer and working on class projects, I’m more confident
in my skills as a software developer. When I’m not in class, I enjoy
spending my time learning new skills by doing projects such as
learning to make a game in Unreal Engine. I am currently seeking a
position as a software intern over summer 2020. I appreciate your
time in coming to view my profile, you may contact me at my email
(brianna@rentfrow.us) or here on LinkedIn.
