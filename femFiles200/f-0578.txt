Abigail Ford
Associate Full Stack Software Developer at PwC
Dallas/Fort Worth Area
Summary
I started my career as an Associate Software Developer with
PwC's Tax Technology group in July of 2018. The life of a software
developer has always interested me because the work aligns so well
with my personality. I thrive in fast-paced environments with many
opportunities for learning and growth, and I’ve always had a passion
for technology, business, and people. Having held many leadership
roles throughout high school and college, I’ve developed a love of
teaching and helping others reach their fullest potential. My hope
is that I can eventually become a master in my field and share that
knowledge with others.
I enjoy many different hobbies in my spare time. Growing up as a
dancer, I still like to pull out my tap shoes now and again or attend
the occasional Zumba class. I am very thankful for my years in
dance as they taught me how to be disciplined and dedicated to my
commitments. I also love to draw and paint, especially if it’s a portrait
of a friend or family member.
My husband and I have two dog babies that we love dearly - a
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Penny and a Boston Terrier
named Hobbes. Being one of five kids, I enjoy visiting home with my
puppies and having dinner with the family.
I look forward to connecting with you!
