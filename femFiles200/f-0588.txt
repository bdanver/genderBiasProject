Summary
Coding has been a hobby of mine for many years. I took online
classes and followed along with YouTube tutorials to help get my
projects off the ground, but my schedule as a psychologist made
it really difficult to find the time to take my hobby to the next level.
I wanted to make this a career, so I finally committed to learning
to become a full-stack web developer with Lambda School. It was
an easy and exciting transition as I’m used to long hours, pushing
through challenges, and working hard to get my job done. Now, I’m
six months into my Lambda journey, and my passion for coding still
remains with me. There’s so much more to learn, more problems
to solve, and many more projects to build. And for that, I am very
excited.
