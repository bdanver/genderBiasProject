Brianna Potvin
Senior Development Engineer at Microsoft
Seattle, Washington
Summary
I have spent the last few years defining and building new product
categories that change how people interact with the digital world.
On the Surface Hub team, I focused on how multiple users can use
large interactive displays together to enhance their collaboration and
communication. I am now part of the team building out Microsoft's
Mixed Reality vision; helping users interact with Holograms with the
HoloLens and exploring virtual worlds with Microsoft's new Mixed
Reality headsets. From large 80 inch screens to no screens at all,
I love helping people experience technology in new, natural, and
inventive ways.
