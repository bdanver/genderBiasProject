Summary
I'm a software engineer with a background in journalism. I have
experience with the MERN Stack (Node.js, React, Express,
MongoDB), JavaScript, Meteor, Ruby on Rails, Redux, and HTML/
CSS. Over the course of my career and personal projects, I've
also worked with Slate.js, Redis, Google Maps API, Amazon Web
Services (AWS), Rails Action Cable, and Web Audio API.
I have an eye for sleek user-friendly design and I love writing clean
code, working with other people on tough problems and tenacious
bugs, and learning new things along the way. For fun, I enjoy
traveling, playing guitar, and going to music festivals.
